MAKE SURE YOU PULL ALL CODE INTO YOUR IDE

- The only way I made this work was by creating a new repository through Visual Studio
- If you want to make changes to the code or add new files/code, please commit and push through visual studio
- you have to connect your GitHub account to Visual Studio to do this
- This is how I learned to clone repositories and commit changes through VS: https://youtu.be/yDIncg-5c8Y?si=Iw1aXDGr2QRHTUO-
