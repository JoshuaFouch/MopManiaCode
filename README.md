# Josh, Eljay, and Seamus Game Project

MAKE SURE YOU PULL ALL CODE INTO YOUR IDE

- The only way I made this work was by creating a new repository through Visual Studio
- If you want to make changes to the code or add new files/code, please commit and push through visual studio
- you have to connect your GitHub account to Visual Studio to do this
- This is how you can commit changes, pull changes, and push code and changes into this repo: https://youtu.be/yDIncg-5c8Y?si=Iw1aXDGr2QRHTUO      - 
- Here is how to clone a repo through GitHub and Visual Studio: https://youtu.be/E2RjolZw1TM?si=IroP4w3ByeC10OZW
          - this is how you can take the code from this repository and put it into your IDE



# INCLUDE GUARD ADVICE

## For Header files
- make forward declarations (class enemy)
- DO NOT #include other header files

## For implementation files
- this is where you #include other header files

## In the main game .cpp file
- #include all header files and other libraries needed


# When we are coding
- make sure everyone is working on DIFFERENT files to make sure there is no conflicts within the code/pulling and pushing into the remote repository
